 * For example, if I post my solutions to these labs on GitHub after I
 * finish ECE351, and a future student plagiarizes them, then I too
 * could be found guilty of plagiarism. Consequently, my final grade
 * in ECE351 could be retroactively lowered. This might require that I
 * repeat ECE351, which in turn might delay my graduation.
